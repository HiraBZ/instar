# Instar Lab

We pioneer advanced scientific research for exploration and mapping of the universe known and unknown with full transparency for public consumption. Our deep space program pushes the boundaries of civilization as we guide humanity into new understanding of life outside planet Earth. We continue to create trends in HCI, UX Research, and Data Analytics for Silicon Valley, the Non-Profit Sector, and Enterprises worldwide.

## Getting Started
  These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  Tools/IDE:
  1. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code <small>(Preferred)</small></a> or any another IDE to make changes into the code.
  2. Git should be installed in the system.

  Languages/Technologies used in the project:
  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. JavaScript
  4. JQuery

### Installation:
  #### Direct Download

      ```
      
  3. If using <b>VS Code</b> project can be opened directly using command line:
      ```sh
      $ code .
      ```
     Else open the project in your code editor.

  **Note: Always make a new branch before making changes.**


  ### To see your changes locally when you make changes:
  1. Open the html file in which changes were made directly in the browser and <kbd>Command/ctrl + R</kbd> - Reload  everytime if you make changes.
